# portswigger-labs

The scripts in this repo are solutions to some of the [Portswigger Academy Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs). My goal with these is to enhance my understanding of labs that I've solved by scripting out the solutions.

The idea came from [Rana Khalil's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RanaKhalil101), and some of the solutions did as well. I tried solving these myself after seeing how she approached them, but in some cases I used her examples.

This is not an exhaustive repo, but I hope to build it out over time.
